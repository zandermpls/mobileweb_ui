            The Android Operating System, developed and distributed by Google Inc., is steadfast and growing in population. It is Linux-based, designed primarily for touch screen mobile devices such as smartphones, like the popular Galaxy Nexus line, and tablets, like the Nexus 7. Android is run on open source code, which grants users the ability to customize and install outside software onto their devices. As of October 2012, over 25 billion applications were downloaded from Google Play, Android's primary app store. This number continues to grow. Android's worldwide smartphone market share was 75% in the third quarter of 2012. As of May 2013, 900 million Android devices had been activated and 48 billion apps installed from the Google Play store.

            The iOS Operating System, derived from OS X and developed and distributed by Apple Inc., was originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone. Since then it has been expanding and extending to support other devices such as the iPod Touch and the iPad. iOS does not allow for installation of their products on non-iOS products. Applications for iOS devices have been downlowded more than 50 billion times! This number continues to grow. In June 2012, it accounted for 65% of mobile web data usage. As of the first quarter in 2013, the iOS iPad accounted for nearly 90% of all web access from a mobile device! This means that your business should have a slick interface when viewed on the iPad, whether it is viewed from a fully built application or even as a Mobile Web App.
